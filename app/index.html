    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Internet Marketing, SEO, &amp; Web Development</h3>

    <h2>Here&rsquo;s how I got started&hellip;</h2>
    <p>My fascination with the internet and web development started over 3 years ago when I pursued a Masters in Integrated Marketing Communications. My first technical course was in Search Engine Optimization, and I became interested in using website analytics and data to improve websites. I became a Director of Operations for Send It Rising Internet Marketing, where we developed websites for clients, performed SEO, and managed PPC ads.</p>
    <p>As I became more knowledgeable about websites and the internet, I decided that web development was my passion. I love that it requires both a technical and creative skill set, and I enjoy bringing ideas to life.</p>
    <p>I have completed many courses from Treehouse and Udemy, including full courses dedicated to front end web development and web design. My goals are to expand into back end web development and to develop into a JavaScript expert.</p>

    <h2>Areas of Expertise</h2>
  
    <img src="assets/images/icons/rain.svg">
    <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
    <p>Coming from an internet marketing background, I understand the importance of making a website look good and function well on different devices. Your website is an important touch point for your audience, and you don't want to lose them because the website doesn't work well on mobile. Using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, I make aesthetically pleasing and functional websites for users of multiple devices.</p>

    <h3>User Experience &amp; Internet Marketing</h3>
    <p>A clean website, proper website structure, and fast load times are fundamental to a good user experience. I incorporate this philosophy into my projects.</p>

    <h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) &amp; Analytics</h3>
    <p>You want your website to be found, and optimizing your website for search engines is one key way for your audience to find your site. I practice white hat SEO techniques and have gotten many local businesses' websites on the first page of Google.</p>
